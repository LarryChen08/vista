# Image Recognition Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the workflow for implementing image recognition within the VISTA project using custom code. The workflow will take an image and location as inputs and return descriptive text as output.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Input Preparation**
   - **Image**: Capture or select an image using the device's camera or gallery.
   - **Location**: Obtain the current GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the device.

2. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - **Step 1**: Preprocess the image (resize, normalize) for model input.
   - **Step 2**: Use a pre-trained image captioning model (e.g., BLIP, InstructBLIP) to generate a caption.
   - **Step 3**: Integrate location data to enhance the caption with contextual information.

3. **Model Execution**
   - Load the model using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
   - Pass the preprocessed image through the model to obtain a caption.
   - Combine the caption with location data to generate a comprehensive description.

4. **Output**
   - Return the generated text description.
   - Display the text in the application interface, providing users with insights about the captured image and its context.

## Integration Points
- **Frontend**: Implement the camera and location capture functionality.
- **Backend**: Develop API endpoints to handle image and location data processing.
- **Model Hosting**: Consider hosting the model on a cloud service or using a local server with GPU support.

## Considerations
- Ensure that the image size is optimized for quick processing.
- Handle any errors or exceptions in the workflow gracefully, providing user feedback if necessary.

## Conclusion
By following this workflow, the VISTA application can effectively implement image recognition using custom code, enhancing the user experience with real-time, context-aware information.
